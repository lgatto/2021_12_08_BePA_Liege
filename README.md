### Title

An introduction to computational spatial proteomics

### Abstract

Mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics data is composed of
quantitative data and localisation data for a limited, but well known
subset of proteins. A typical spatial proteomics data analysis starts
with the visualisation of the experiment to assess the quality of the
quantitative data their annotation, followed by the prediction of the
missing localisations based on the protein organelle-specific
quantitative profiles. While these two steps rely on well known
machine learning approaches, namely (unsupervised) dimensionality
reduction and (supervised) classification, there's more to it. More
advanced, and biologically interesting questions lead to the
application of semi-supervised organelle discovery approaches,
probabilistic localisation models and localisation dynamics between
multiple conditions . In this talk, I will be deconstructing the basic
and more advanced analysis pipelines steps to provide an accessible
introduction to computational spatial proteomics.
